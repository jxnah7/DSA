FIFO Data-Structure, First In First Out

enqueue- adding an object at the end of the queue
dequeue- removing an object at the beginning of the queue

Keep in mind a queue and stack are largely the same syntax, just how you use it will determine what is it

ex.

if you init a deque() function, and use append/pop, that is the behaviour of a stack

if you init a deque() function, and use append/popleft, that is the behaviour of a queue.

popleft() removes the element in the very front of the queue.



the syntax is basic, sometimes in larger programs wrappers might be used to make readability better
