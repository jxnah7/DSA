#learning hashmaps
  #hashmaps or dictionaries in python hold information
    #called values and pair them up with unique identifiers called keys
#used for readability and search in O(1)

#usually built off of a array and indexes
#using hash function it gets mapped to an index on the array

#once mapped data to a key it cannot be changed
#this means any key in a hashmap must be immutable

#so instead of an array maybe convert it to a tuple
#hashmaps can go by dictionaries
